# Kubernetes-Scheduler
 This repository includes a Bash script and Kubernetes Deployment definition for managing pending pods in a Kubernetes cluster. The script assigns pending pods to a custom scheduler and binds them to a random node. Customizable parameters are available for server address, scheduler name, and sleep interval. For educational and testing purposes.
